# Popolo: International open government data specifications

Goal: Define data interchange formats and data models so that organizations can spend less time transforming and modeling data and more time applying it to the problems they face.

Popolo supports the development of reusable open source components that implement the specifications, making it easier for civic developers to create civic software.
